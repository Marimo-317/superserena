# Integration Test Phase 2 Results

## Token Usage Comparison
- **Standard Read tool**: Successfully read dev.md (~4,000 tokens)
- **Serena pattern search**: Failed with token overflow (34,114 tokens > 25,000 limit)

## Serena MCP Status
- ✅ Serena tools are available and responding
- ❌ Semantic analysis returned empty for current directory (no code files)
- ❌ Token optimization not performing as expected (exceeding limits vs reducing)

## Next Steps
- Test with actual code files for better semantic analysis
- Investigate Serena configuration for token optimization
- Continue with Phase 3 SuperClaude testing
