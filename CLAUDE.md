npm run start        # Run production server
npm run dev          # Development server with ts-node
npm test             # Run test suite
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run lint         # Check code quality
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run monitor      # Start monitoring dashboard (dev)
npm run monitor:prod # Start monitoring dashboard (production)
```

## 🤖 SPARC Methodology & Agents

### SPARC Development Process
1. **Specification**: Define clear, testable requirements
2. **Pseudocode**: Create modular blueprints with TDD anchors
3. **Architecture**: Design scalable, secure systems

## 💡 Token Optimization with Serena

**ALWAYS use Serena's semantic tools instead of file reading!**

Serena provides:
- **find_symbol**: Locate classes, methods, interfaces by name
- **get_symbols_overview**: High-level file structure understanding
- **search_for_pattern**: Intelligent code pattern matching
- **replace_symbol_body**: Modify entire functions/classes efficiently

**Token Savings Example**:
```bash
# ❌ Traditional approach (100% tokens)
Read entire file → Find method → Understand context → Make changes

# ✅ Serena approach (20% tokens) 
find_symbol "methodName" → replace_symbol_body with changes
```

## 🏗️ Custom Commands

## 📊 Quality Standards

### Development Quality
- **Test Coverage**: >90% unit tests, >70% integration tests
- **Security**: OWASP Top 10 compliance, bcrypt (12 rounds)
- **Performance**: <100ms API response, <3s page load
- **Code Quality**: ESLint clean, TypeScript strict mode

### Security Features
- **Authentication**: bcrypt password hashing with 12 salt rounds
- **Email Validation**: RFC 5322 compliant with XSS protection
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive validation layer
- **CORS Configuration**: Secure cross-origin policies

### Monitoring System
- **Real-time Dashboard**: WebSocket-based live metrics
- **Execution Tracking**: Agent activity visualization
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and resource usage
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: CI/CD monitoring

## 🚀 Common Workflows

### Starting New Feature Development
```bash
# Use mega-build for comprehensive development
Tell sparc-orchestrator to execute /mega-build "feature-name"

# Or use specific agents for targeted tasks
Tell sparc-architect to design the system architecture
Tell sparc-coder to implement with TDD approach
Tell sparc-security-reviewer to audit the implementation
```

### Code Analysis and Understanding
```bash
# Use Serena for efficient code navigation
Use find_symbol to locate specific classes/methods
Use get_symbols_overview for file structure
Use search_for_pattern for cross-file searches
```

### Testing and Quality Assurance
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
npm test

# Security audit
Tell sparc-security-reviewer to perform security audit

# Performance optimization
Tell sparc-performance to analyze and optimize
```

## 📝 Best Practices

1. **Always use Serena** for code navigation (80% token savings)
2. **Follow SPARC methodology** for systematic development
3. **Leverage parallel agents** for complex tasks
4. **Maintain test coverage** above required thresholds
5. **Use monitoring dashboard** for real-time insights
6. **Create memories** for cross-session knowledge persistence

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **High token usage**: Ensure you're using Serena instead of file reading
- **Test failures**: Check test coverage requirements (>90% unit)
- **Performance issues**: Use sparc-performance for optimization
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Run sparc-security-reviewer audit

### Windows-Specific Considerations
- Use forward slashes in file paths for cross-platform compatibility
- PowerShell recommended for system commands
- Ensure proper line endings (CRLF) in Git configuration
