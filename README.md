**Symptoms**: "Agent type 'sparc-orchestrator' not found"
**Solution**: Verify agent files follow official specification in `.claude/agents/`

#### Serena Semantic Analysis Failing
**Symptoms**: Empty results, token overflow errors
**Solution**: Ensure TypeScript files exist and project is activated in Serena

#### Session Configuration Issues
**Symptoms**: Components configured but not active
**Solution**: Restart Claude Code session to load updated configurations

### Performance Optimization
- **Use Semantic Navigation**: Prefer Serena tools over file reading
- **Enable Parallel Agents**: Coordinate multiple specialists simultaneously  
- **Leverage Memory System**: Use persistent knowledge for efficiency
- **Token Management**: Use --uc flag for automatic compression when needed

### Maintenance Procedures
```bash
# Weekly environment verification
claude mcp list  # Verify Serena MCP connection
npm test         # Validate all test suites
