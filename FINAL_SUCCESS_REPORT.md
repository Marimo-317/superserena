## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis (Final)

### **Primary Issue**: Session State vs Configuration
**Discovery**: All components were properly configured but required session restart to activate.

**Evidence**:
- SuperClaude metadata showed v3.0.0 installation
- All agent files were specification-compliant
- Serena MCP was properly connected
- Settings.json contained correct configuration

**Resolution**: Session restart loaded updated configurations successfully.

### **Secondary Issue**: Serena Language Server
**Discovery**: TypeScript language detection required project activation.

**Evidence**:
- Post-restart semantic analysis working perfectly
- Symbol finding with precise line numbers
- Cross-file reference mapping operational
- Pattern search across multiple files functional
