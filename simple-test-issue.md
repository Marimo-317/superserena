## 📋 Feature Description
Create a simple HTTP request logging middleware for Express.js to test the enhanced SuperClaude automation system with full file creation capabilities.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create middleware that logs incoming HTTP requests
- [ ] Log format: `[timestamp] method URL from IP`
- [ ] Integrate with existing Express app in src/app.ts
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for log data
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Include integration test with Express app
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Update README with usage instructions

## 🎯 Estimated Complexity
Simple (single component, basic logic)

## 🔧 Technical Domains
- Backend/API Development
- Testing/Quality Assurance

## ⚙️ Technical Requirements
- Use TypeScript with existing patterns
- Compatible with Express.js middleware pattern
- Follow existing code structure in src/middleware/
- Include proper JSDoc documentation
- Use existing testing framework (Jest)

## 🧪 Enhanced SuperClaude Test
This issue specifically tests the enhanced SuperClaude system with:
- ✅ Full file creation permissions
- ✅ npm/node command execution
- ✅ Testing and linting capabilities
- ✅ Git operations and PR creation

Expected deliverables:
- `src/middleware/requestLogger.ts` - Main implementation
- `src/types/logger.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `tests/requestLogger.test.ts` - Unit tests
- `tests/requestLogger.integration.test.ts` - Integration tests
- Updated `src/app.ts` with middleware integration
- Updated `README.md` with documentation
