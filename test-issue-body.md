## 📋 Feature Description
Create a comprehensive request rate limiting middleware for our Express.js API to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage across all endpoints. The middleware should be configurable, performant, and include proper monitoring capabilities.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware with configurable limits
- [ ] Default limit: 100 requests per hour per IP address
- [ ] Support different limits for different endpoints
- [ ] Return 429 (Too Many Requests) status when limit exceeded
- [ ] Include proper error response with retry-after header
- [ ] Implement IP-based tracking with memory-efficient storage
- [ ] Support whitelist for trusted IPs (configurable)
- [ ] Add rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)
- [ ] Configurable via environment variables (RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS, RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS)
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation if storage fails
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for rate limit violations
- [ ] Create unit tests with >90% coverage
- [ ] Add integration tests for various scenarios
- [ ] Include performance benchmarks
- [ ] Update API documentation

## 🎯 Estimated Complexity
Moderate (multiple components, some logic)

## 🔧 Technical Domains
- Backend/API Development
- Security/Authentication
- Performance/Optimization
- Testing/Quality Assurance

## ⚙️ Technical Requirements
- Use Express.js compatible middleware pattern
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns in src/middleware/
- Implement using memory-efficient data structures
- Must not significantly impact API response time (<5ms overhead)
- Should be compatible with clustered deployments
- Follow SOLID principles and clean code practices
- Include proper error handling and recovery

## 🔍 Additional Context
- This is a critical security feature to prevent API abuse
- Should integrate seamlessly with existing error handling middleware
- Consider using proven algorithms like sliding window or token bucket
- Reference existing middleware patterns in the codebase
- Priority on reliability and performance over complex features
