## Batch Development Command

Run multiple specialized agents in parallel for rapid development and optimization.

### Usage:
`/batch-dev [task-list]`

### Example Usage:

#### Feature Development Batch:
```
/batch-dev "authentication-system":
- sparc-architect: Design OAuth2 microservice architecture
- sparc-coder: Implement JWT token service with TDD
- sparc-security-reviewer: Conduct security audit of auth flow
- sparc-tdd: Create comprehensive test suite for auth endpoints
- sparc-performance: Optimize token validation performance
- sparc-devops: Setup CI/CD pipeline for auth service
```

#### Code Quality Batch:
```
/batch-dev "quality-improvement":
- sparc-performance: Profile and optimize critical code paths
- sparc-security-reviewer: Scan for security vulnerabilities
- sparc-tdd: Improve test coverage to >90%
- sparc-coder: Refactor legacy code with clean architecture
```

#### Infrastructure Batch:
```
/batch-dev "infrastructure-setup":
- sparc-devops: Setup Kubernetes cluster with monitoring
- sparc-architect: Design microservices deployment architecture
- sparc-security-reviewer: Implement zero-trust network security
- sparc-performance: Configure auto-scaling and load balancing
```

### Parallel Execution Benefits:
- **5-10x Speed**: Simultaneous execution of independent tasks
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient agent workload distribution
- **Context Sharing**: Automatic coordination between agents
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in cross-validation between specialists

### Orchestration Pattern:
1. **Task Analysis**: sparc-orchestrator analyzes task dependencies
2. **Agent Assignment**: Optimal agent selection based on expertise
3. **Parallel Execution**: Independent tasks run simultaneously
4. **Synchronization Points**: Coordination for dependent tasks
5. **Integration**: Final integration and validation

### Command Templates:

#### Full-Stack Feature:
```
Tell sparc-orchestrator to coordinate batch development:
- sparc-architect: [System design task]
- sparc-coder: [Implementation task]
- sparc-tdd: [Testing task]
- sparc-security-reviewer: [Security task]
- sparc-performance: [Optimization task]
- sparc-devops: [Infrastructure task]
```

#### Focused Optimization:
```
Execute batch optimization:
- sparc-performance: [Performance optimization]
- sparc-security-reviewer: [Security hardening]
- sparc-tdd: [Test coverage improvement]
```

### Success Metrics:
- **Execution Time**: 70-85% reduction vs sequential execution
- **Quality Gates**: All specialist validations passed
- **Token Efficiency**: 80% savings through Serena integration
- **Memory Persistence**: Results saved for future reference

### Integration Features:
- **Serena Optimization**: All agents use semantic analysis
- **Memory Sharing**: Cross-agent context and results sharing
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status of parallel tasks
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery and rollback
